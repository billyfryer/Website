<p>Conference USA has looked great so far this season. MTSU WBB upset Louisville behind a huge 3 point shooting night. Courtney Whitson contributed a Double Double and Sav Wheeler had 23 against the Cardinals.</p>
<p>What’s agruably more impressive is the Blue Raider’s Defense. The held Louisville to (at the time) season lows in shooting and 3 Point Percentage. Almost breaking the chart low. Adding this win to the one over Belmont, MTSU definitely deserved AP Poll votes at the time.</p>
