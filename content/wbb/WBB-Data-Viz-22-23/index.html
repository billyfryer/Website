<h1>Missing Pieces</h1>
<p>Due to WNBA obligations, the Brazilian National Team will be without several key pieces in these preseason match ups. The team announced Pokey Chatman, Associate General Manager and Assistant Coach for the Seattle Storm, will be their head coach for this Olympic Cycle culminating in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
<p>The team will also be missing several post players from their announced roster for this, the biggest being Kamilla Cardoso-Silva. Standing at 6‚Äô 7‚Äù, Cardoso will be suiting up against her National Team in the first match up as she is a projected starter for the Sky this year. She started 29 of the 32 games she participated in last season, showing good efficiency around the rim shooting 55% from within 5 feet on 6.3 attempts per game.</p>
<p>In Team Brazil‚Äôs second match up with the Indiana Fever, they will be playing against another Brazilian WBB icon: Damiris Dantas. Dantas is a 6‚Äô 3‚Äù pick and pop post player with 9 years of WNBA experience including several years in Minnesota with Team USA Head Coach Cheryl Reeve. Dantas has been a staple on the Brazilian National Team since her debut with the Senior Team in 2010. In that time span, she‚Äôs averaged 12 points per game, including 16.8 points per game in the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
<p>Another Brazilian WBB stalwart missing from this preliminary roster is Clarissa dos Santos. Dos Santos last appeared for Team Brazil in 2021 edition of the AmeriCup but has appeared in clubs around the world since, most recently in Portugal for Benfica. The 6 foot forward‚Äôs leadership will surely be missed by
As Canarinhas.</p>
