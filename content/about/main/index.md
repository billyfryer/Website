  I am currently working for SportsMediaTechnology (SMT) as a part of SMT-U! In my role, I help support the SMT Data Challenge and Data Derbies. It really is a full circle moment for me as I was the inaugural winner of the SMT Data Challenge my senior year of college. I'm excited for what's to come of this new part of the company!
  
  I previously was the Basketball Data Analyst for the Indiana Fever- the second one in the entire WNBA. I built the program from the ground up including but not limited to pre and post game scouting reports, salary cap and collective bargaining agreement analysis, and plenty of ad hoc analysis. During my tenure, the Fever went from 5 wins the year prior to 13 my first season to 20 my second season including a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2023.
  
  I previously worked with the NC State Women's Basketball (2021-2023) and Baseball (2019-2023) teams. I was also the President of the Sports Analytics Club at NC State from 2021-2023. I also interned with John Deere in Summer 2021 and with Sports Reference in Summer 2022 contributing to their launch of the Women's College Basketball site!
  
   I am from Columbiana, Alabama - a small town halfway between Birmingham and Montgomery that I love dearly.  I graduated top of my class in both Statistics and Spanish from North Carolina State University in Spring 2023.
  
  During my junior year of college, the NC State College of Sciences did a feature about me! A link to the article is here: [Using Statistics to Support Champions](https://sciences.ncsu.edu/news/using-statistics-to-support-champions/).
